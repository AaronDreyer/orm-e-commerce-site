  ## [Description](#table-of-contents)

  This challenge is a back end for an e-commerce site used to store databases and tables for individual categories, products, and tags. This demonstrates how to use applications such as mysql, express.js, and sequlize to create a functioning back end using object relational mapping.

  This challenge was created to demonstrate my knowledge of object relational mapping for the Georgia Tech Coding Bootcamp.

  A user can use this challenge to access databases and tables filled with data such as categories, products, and tags for an e-commerce site. A user can also review the code to become familiar with object relational mapping, express.js, mysql, and sequelize.

  ## [Installation](#table-of-contents)

  In order to install this challenge, the user must access the github repository its stored in and then git cloning the code to their local device. After this, the user can npm intsall all relative applications and use the challenge.

  ## [Usage](#table-of-contents)

  In order to operate this challenge, the user needs to npm intsall all applications associated with the challenge. Once this is done, the user must update the env file to include their password used for mysql. Once this is complete, the user can npm start to activate the program and use a back end viewer such as insomnia to view its contents.
